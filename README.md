# Python Linting Action

> ⚠️ this is work in progress ⚠️

> 🚨 it does not use an open source license yet, and comes with no support guarantees at all - it is pre-release and still in alpha/testing 🚨

This Action and Python script lets you run one of several Python linters and type checkers, and upload the results to GitHub's Code Scanning.

## Supported linters

- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
- [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/)
- [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/) - for Python 3.10 and below
- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
- [Fixit 2](https://fixit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - for Python 3.8 and above

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- For Pytype, Python 3.10 or lower
- For Fixit, Python 3.8 or higher
- GitHub Actions

## Usage

### Command line

First install the Flake8 SARIF formatter, if you are using Flake8:

```bash
python3 -m pip install ./flake8_sarif_formatter
```

Then run the linter:

```bash
python3 ./python_lint <linter> [<linter> ...] [<options>]
```

The linter/type checker can be one or more of `flake8`, `pylint`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytype`, `pyright`, `fixit`.

### Action

```yaml
use: aegilops/python-lint-code-scanning-action@v0.0.1
with:
  linter: flake8
```

You can run it with more than one linter using a matrix:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        linter: [flake8, pylint, ruff, mypy, pytype, pyright, fixit]
    steps:
      - use: aegilops/python-lint-code-scanning-action@v0.0.1
        with:
          linter: ${{ matrix.linter }}
```

Similarly, you can run it with more than one Python version:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
    steps:
      - use: aegilops/python-lint-code-scanning-action@v0.0.1
        with:
          linter: flake8
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

You could even combine both.

If you want to use plugins for one of the linters, you can install that before running the action, e.g.

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: python3 -mpip install flake8-bugbear
      - use: aegilops/python-lint-code-scanning-action@v0.0.1
        with:
          linter: flake8
```

Configure the linters using a configuration file in your repository, appropriate to the linter.

Many can use `pyproject.toml`, but not all.

Example `pyproject.toml` and `.flake8` files for linting this repository are included.

## FAQ

### Why not use the existing Python linting Actions?

They don't all produce SARIF, and they don't upload to Code Scanning.

### Why not create N different Actions?

It's far more convenient to have one Action that can run all of the popular linters, so you can configure it once and then run it with different linters.

### Could you let me configure the linters using the Action's inputs?

No, because the configuration files are specific to each linter. Providing convenience abstractions over the inputs for all of the linters would be significantly more work than just using the configuration files.

It's possible that a future release might allow you to specify some very common shared options, such as line-length, but for now that's not been tackled.

### Why not add SARIF output directly to the linters, and then call them?

Good idea. That's something to consider for the future. For now it was quicker and easier to call the linters and process their output into SARIF, vs raising PRs against each linter.

### You really should provide some sensible defaults for the linters

Wow, so opinionated! We decided not to be opinionated 😁. Linting is very individual, and deciding on defaults beyond those of the tools themselves could prove to be a thankless task. Hopefully if you want to use these linters then you'll be able to configure them to your liking.

### What about tool X?

Lots of linters are wrapped up or replicated by these linters.

`pydocstyle` can be run using a plugin to Flake8, and `mccabe` is included in Flake8.

If there's one you really need that isn't runnable, please raise an issue or a PR to include it.

### Why can't I run all of the linters in one go?

Actions lets you do a matrix job, which does great work in parallelising things.

We could use Python multi-processing to run them all in parallel, but that doesn't make such sense on standard GitHub runners.

If you want to run them all at once you can call the underlying script with multiple linters, but that feature is really just to make testing easier, since they run in series.
